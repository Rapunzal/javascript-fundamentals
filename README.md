# SBA 308:JavaScript Fundamentals

## Objectives

- Employ basic JavaScript syntax accurately.
- Implement control flow structures such as conditionals and loops effectively.
- Use arrays and objects to organize and manage data.
- Develop functions to create reusable code.
- Utilize loops and iteration to navigate through data collections.
- Implement error handling to manage potential code failures gracefully.

## What the project does

The project consist of a script getLearnerData that gathers data, processes it, and then outputs a consistent result as specified.It accepts input as courseInfo, AssignmentGroup and LearnerSubmission.The output of the script is Learners profile in an assignment within a course.
